# ClusterWordsVB
machine learning algorithm in VB.net

This is my attempt at creating an unsupervised cluster association of words and topics using dictionary definitions.

The main reason it is here is because access to merriam-webster API required an URL to my application, so here it is.

My idea for this actually originated several years ago, before I had ever heard of machine learning or looked into the topic. Lately I
had been putting more thought into how us humans create assocations in our brains and am putting my ideas to use.
